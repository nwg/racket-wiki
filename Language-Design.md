### Special Interest Group on Programming Languages
The ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) explores programming language concepts and tools, focusing on design, implementation, practice, and theory. Its members are programming language developers, educators, implementers, researchers, theoreticians, and users.

**Smalltalk**, an influential language design: <https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08>

Also interesting, but not on language design:
Anders Hejlsberg on the gap between how compilers are taught and how modern compilers work.
