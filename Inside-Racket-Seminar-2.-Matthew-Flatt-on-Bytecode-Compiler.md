As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on March 15th, 2016, [Matthew Flatt](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/) spoke about the [bytecode compiler](http://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/decompile.html) with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io) and [Gustavo Massaccesi](http://gus-massa.blogspot.com.ar)

The archived Google Hangouts on Air event is [here](https://plus.google.com/events/cjf9s8p98ks8d7attk0fdem2t88?hl=en). It is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXk7sqZEIk).

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and is not an introduction to Racket itself.

We used [commit 182d648](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/182d648af68a2eaf92e8bf9899e359d368bcbe3b) of the Racket package for the walk-through, which was current at the time.
