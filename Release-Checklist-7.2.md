  - [ ] Games Tests: play a bunch of games (not automated)

  - [ ] PLaneT Tests: 
   ```
   # (the output of these tests is hard to read)
   raco test -l tests/planet/run-all
   ```
   
   - [ ] Redex Tests:
   ```
   racket -l redex/tests/run-tests
   # the results of color-tests require interpretation (and clicking)
   racket -l redex/tests/color-tests 
   ```

  - [ ] Teachpacks Tests: check that new teachpacks are addable
      ```
      1. create foo.rkt: #lang racket (define x 0) (provide x)
      2. create bar.rkt: #lang htdp/bsl (require "foo.rkt") x; RUN and check for 0 to pop out
      3. delete require line, use teach pack menu to add foo.rkt; RUN and check for 0 to pop out
      4. delete foo.rkt and bar.rkt
      ```

  - [ ] Teachpack Docs: check teachpack docs in the bundles
      ```
      type "big-bang" into Definitions area, highlight, use F1; check for manuals 
      ```

* [ ] {Vincent St-Amour <stamourv@racket-lang.org>}

    + [ ] Test that the `racket` and `racket-minimal` source releases
        compile fine.
    + [ ] Test that the binary installers for both work, try each one in
        both normal and unix-style installation modes.
  - [ ] FrTime Tests
    + [ ] Test that expressions with time-varying values (e.g., `seconds`,
        `(build-list (modulo seconds 10) identity)`) render and update as
        expected in the FrTime language level. Check that they continue
        updating even after a garbage collection.
    + [ ] Test that a sampling of graphical demos (e.g., `analog-clock.rkt`,
        `tetris.rkt`) work as expected, responding to relevant key and mouse
        events and interactions with control widgets.
