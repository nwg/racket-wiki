##### Specifying a HMAC-SHA1 stuffer for the stateless web-server

```racket
#:stuffer (stuffer-chain
            serialize-stuffer
            (stuffer-compose base64-stuffer
                             (HMAC-SHA1-stuffer #"mysupersecretkey")))
```

##### Split a string into lines

```racket
(regexp-split "\n+" str)
```

##### Fetch the contents of a URL

```racket
(require net/url)
(port->string (get-pure-port (string->url "https://www.google.com")))
```
##### generate a n-byte key for use in MAC authentication (like HMAC-SHA1)
```racket
;usage (generate-authenticator-key 128) -> returns 128-byte key
(define/contract (generate-authenticator-key key-len)
  (-> exact-positive-integer? bytes?)
  (list->bytes (build-list key-len (Î» _ (random 255)))))
```
##### How to generate a Message Authentication Code and authenticate a signed message.
```racket
#|
This would be useful for creating an "Unforgeable Authenticator Cookie", per the MIT 
Cookie Eater's recommendations (see: Do's And Don'ts of Client Authentication on the Web, Fu et al"
|#

(require web-server/stuffers/hmac-sha1)

(define *private-key* (generate-authenticator-key 128))

(define *signed-message* (let* ((plaintext #"We are Spinal Tap!")
                                (MAC (HMAC-SHA1 plaintext *private-key*)))
                           (bytes-append MAC plaintext)))
  
;;now we lose custody of *signed-message* by sending it to the client...

;;and now we get *signed-message* back and attempt to authenticate it

(let ((received-MAC (subbytes *signed-message* 0 20))
      (received-plaintext (subbytes *signed-message* 20)))
  (if (bytes=? received-MAC
               (HMAC-SHA1 received-plaintext 
                          *private-key*))
      "Message is authentic and not forged"
      "Message has been forged"))

```
