##### Specifying a HMAC-SHA1 stuffer for the stateless web-server

```racket
#:stuffer (stuffer-chain
            serialize-stuffer
            (stuffer-compose base64-stuffer
                             (HMAC-SHA1-stuffer #"mysupersecretkey")))
```

##### Split a string into lines

```racket
(regexp-split "\n+" str)
```

###### Thanks to Zack Galler for the suggestion.
