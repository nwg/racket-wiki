This page captures useful code snippets that are too small to be a Planet package. 

##### Specifying a HMAC-SHA1 stuffer for the stateless web-server

```racket
#:stuffer (stuffer-chain
            serialize-stuffer
            (stuffer-compose base64-stuffer
                             (HMAC-SHA1-stuffer #"mysupersecretkey")))
```

##### Split a string into lines

```racket
(regexp-split "\n+" str)
```

##### Fetch the contents of a URL

```racket
(require net/url)
(port->string (get-pure-port (string->url "https://www.google.com")))
```
##### generate a n-byte key for use in MAC authentication (like HMAC-SHA1)
```racket
;usage (generate-authenticator-key 128) -> returns 128-byte key
(define/contract (generate-authenticator-key key-len)
  (-> exact-positive-integer? bytes?)
  (list->bytes (build-list key-len (Î» _ (random 255)))))
```
##### How to generate a Message Authentication Code and authenticate a signed message.
```racket
#|
This would be useful for creating an "Unforgeable Authenticator Cookie", per the MIT 
Cookie Eater's recommendations (see: "Do's And Don'ts of Client Authentication on the Web", Fu at para 4.1)
|#

(require web-server/stuffers/hmac-sha1)

(define *private-key* (generate-authenticator-key 128))

(define *signed-message* (let* ((plaintext #"We are Spinal Tap!")
                                (MAC (HMAC-SHA1 plaintext *private-key*)))
                           (bytes-append MAC plaintext)))
  
;;now we lose custody of *signed-message* by sending it to the client...

;;and now we get *signed-message* back and attempt to authenticate it

(let ((received-MAC (subbytes *signed-message* 0 20))
      (received-plaintext (subbytes *signed-message* 20)))
  (if (bytes=? received-MAC
               (HMAC-SHA1 received-plaintext 
                          *private-key*))
      "Message is authentic and not forged"
      "Message has been forged"))

```
##### Controversial code: cleaning up state on exit, when errors are expected
```racket
#|
Explanation: this code creates an unhygenic macro which will execute any number of procedures while ignoring errors thrown.

it most closely resembles Microsoft's "On Error Resume Next", in that it will execute a number of potentially error-causing statements without allowing control-flow to branch.

Many, including Matthew F. strongly believe that dynamic-wind is the correct primitive to use instead this macro. I use dynamic-wind a lot, and still find the (finally...) macro has utility.

|#
(require mzlib/defmacro)

;USAGE: (finally proc1 proc2 proc3...)

(define-macro (finally . (fn . rest))
  (let ((out (gensym))
        (k   (gensym)))
  `(let* ((,out #f))
    (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (exn) (printf "~A\n" (exn-message exn)) (,out))])
      ,@(map (lambda (f) `(let/cc ,k (set! ,out ,k) ,f)) (cons fn rest))))))
```
