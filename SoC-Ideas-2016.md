Welcome! If you are a **student** who is interested in working on a Google Summer of Code project for [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org), you are in the right place. For general information about eligbility, please look [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/) on the GSoC homepage. The projects listed here are ideas that the community is excited about and would be willing to mentor for. Note that you are not restricted to these ideas. If you have your own project idea, we encourage you to discuss it on the Racket [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users/).

For more advice on applying for a project, see the [student manual](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/) page. Make sure to use our [[application template|SoC Student Application]] when you apply. We encourage you to get involved on [IRC](http://www.racket-lang.org/community.html) (`#racket` on Freenode.net) or the mailing list prior to applying. Submitting patches to Racket or starting to write code on github is even better. A good place to start is to try one of the small projects on the [[Intro Projects]] page.

If you are a **potential mentor** and/or **community member**, please feel free to add your own project ideas here. Project ideas should be substantial enough to take about 12 weeks, but self-contained enough not to take longer. If you are interested in mentoring a project, please list yourself under the potential mentors of that idea. Don't hesitate to add ideas if you can't mentor yourself; just leave it blank. When you add an idea, please follow the template shown below.

For advice on mentoring, see the [GSoC mentoring manual](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/).

For an idea of what project ideas are like for other orgs, see the ideas for [GNOME](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2012/Ideas), [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc2011), or for [Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/report/1).
