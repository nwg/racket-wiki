Similar to code improvements (docs are code).

* Revise the FFI docs: better docs, lots of examples, guide-like text
* Add a detailed example to the profiler manual.
* Documentation clarifications and/or small examples
* Write tutorials for building small applications and using major features, e.g., the class system or macros.
* Convert Eli's Swindle documentation to Scribble.
* Document the [Macro Stepper]() in the DrRacket Guide

# General Tasks
- Tag packages on pkgs.racket-lang.org, and/or add missing descriptions.
  And if feeling bold, add docs, or convert docs in other formats, if they exist.
- Add a localization for a language you know.
- Try to reproduce old bugs on gnats or github, close if they're not relevant anymore.

# Docs that could use examples
- Racket reference (claim one section at a time. 4 has a number of functions with examples missing, but others probably do too)
- syntax
- racket/draw
- racket/gui & framework (with screenshots) (claim one section at a time)
- scribble, low-level API section
- graphics/turtles & graphics/value-turtles
- string-constants
- syntax-color (not exactly easy to use, examples could really help)
- openssl (make-log-based-evaluator can help here)
- net (claim one section at a time)
- racket/unix-socket
- parser-tools
- file (claim one section at a time)
- data (claim one section at a time)
