As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on September 7th, 2016, [Robby Findler](https://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/) spoke about the [Racket Contract system](https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/master/racket/collects/racket/contract) library with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io).

The Google Hangouts on Air event is [here](https://plus.google.com/events/ca6nh577aoon86pdvqov13il9fk). It is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUsDKbKtrLs).

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and is not an introduction to Racket contracts.

We used [commit 94dbcb1](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/94dbcb12dc5bb33f78f749f4277d1a9e9f17af4b) of Racket for the walk-through.
