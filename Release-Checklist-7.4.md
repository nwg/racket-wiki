* [ ] {John Clements <clements@racket-lang.org>}
  - [ ] Release tests for (one of the) linux releases and the Mac OS release:
    + [ ] Test that the `racket` and `racket-minimal` source releases
        compile fine.
    + [ ] Test that the binary installers for both work, try each one in
        both normal and unix-style installation modes.
  - [ ] FrTime Tests
    + [ ] Test that expressions with time-varying values (e.g., `seconds`,
        `(build-list (modulo seconds 10) identity)`) render and update as
        expected in the FrTime language level. Check that they continue
        updating even after a garbage collection.
    + [ ] Test that a sampling of graphical demos (e.g., `analog-clock.rkt`,
        `tetris.rkt`) work as expected, responding to relevant key and mouse
        events and interactions with control widgets.
  - [ ] Inspect icons
