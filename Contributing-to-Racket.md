### New: [Tutorial: Contributing to Racket](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2017/09/tutorial-contributing-to-racket.html) by Ben Greenman

## Beginners start here:
### An important way you can contribute even if you are very new to Racket;
> While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it
could be improved.  Debugging documentation requires a supply of
ignorance, which is rapidly used up as documentation testers
learn what the documentation means.  So when you find the
documentation obscure, **_treat it as a documentation bug and report it_**.
Maybe, when you become an expert and your supply of ignorance has run
out, you can even propose patches to improve that documentation!  

### ...and how to **report it** ? 
* Send an email with your observations and suggestions to the [Racket mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org) (Racket has a friendly community that welcomes feedback)

# Ways you can contribute to the Racket ecosystem
* Try a [Project](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Project-Ideas)
  * If you make a library, [publish it](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/getting-started.html), so other Racket users can find it and use it.
  * If you make an app you can use DrRacket [to create an executable you can distribute](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/create-exe.html) or use [Raco to create Stand-Alone Executables](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe-dist.html)
* Fix a bug: [Easy bugs to fix](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Easy-bugs-to-fix)
* [Extend DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html) with a [Teachpack](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html#%28part._teachpacks%29) or a [Plugin](https://docs.racket-lang.org/tools/index.html)
* [make your own language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/languages.html)
* [[Integration Projects]] These are improvements to other systems to better support Racket.

## Contribute to the documentation
