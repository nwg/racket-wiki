## Why contribute when you are new to Racket?
> While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it
could be improved.  Debugging documentation requires a supply of
ignorance, which is repidly used up as documentation testers
learn what the documentation means.  So when you find the
documentation obscure, treat it as a documentation bug and report it.
Maybe, when you become an expert and your supply of ignorance has run
out, you can even propose patches to improve that documentation!  

### How? 
* Send an email to the mailing list
* Submit (documentation) bug report via DrRacket
* Submit a patch via GitHub (need to provide guidance because identifying the right file in GitHub is hard if you are new to Racket & Scribble)

See [[Code Improvements]] for a list of tasks. These are improvements to the Racket source.
