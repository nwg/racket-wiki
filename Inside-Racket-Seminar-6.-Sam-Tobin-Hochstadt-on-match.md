As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on November 7th, 2016, [Sam Tobin-Hochstadt](http://samth.github.io) will speak about the [Racket Pattern Matcher](https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/master/racket/collects/racket/match) library with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io).

The YouTube live event is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IikGK8XP5_Q). It will be automatically archived afterwards.

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and is not an introduction to Racket pattern matching.
