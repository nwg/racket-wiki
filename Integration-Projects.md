These are improvements to other systems to better support Racket.

* Racket support for github code editing
* Etags support for Racket features
* Improve Racket support in Ohloh's line counter
* Racket support in MediaWiki's GeSHi highligher
  - Awaiting Integration into GeSHi source: [Tim Brown](mailto:tim@timb.net) has written [racket.php](https://github.com/tim-brown/geshi-racket/blob/master/racket.php), it is scheduled for the next iteration of GeSHi, but the next iteration of GeSHi might be a little while.
* Extend the gabot IRC bot to deliver messages to offline people
  (contact [Eli](mailto:eli@barzilay.org) for more info)
  - Optionally, extend it to do more cool stuffs
  - [rudybot](https://github.com/offby1/rudybot) is another possible starting point
* [LightTable](http://www.lighttable.com/) plugin for Racket. See the [plugin for Haskell](https://github.com/jetaggart/light-haskell) for an example.
* Racket support for CodeMirror.org (see http://codemirror.org/mode/index.html)

## Completed Integration Projects
