These are improvements to other systems to better support Racket.

* Racket support for CodeMirror.org (see http://codemirror.net/mode/index.html) (GitHub uses CodeMirror)
* [LightTable](http://www.lighttable.com/) plugin for Racket. See the [plugin for Haskell](https://github.com/jetaggart/light-haskell) for an example.
* Etags support for Racket features
* Improve Racket support in Ohloh's line counter
* Racket support in [Pygments Syntax highlighter](http://pygments.org/languages/) used by MediaWiki (GeSHi highligher no longer used. [Tim Brown](mailto:tim@timb.net) has written [racket.php](https://github.com/tim-brown/geshi-racket/blob/master/racket.php))
* Extend the gabot IRC bot to deliver messages to offline people
  (contact [Eli](mailto:eli@barzilay.org) for more info)
  - Optionally, extend it to do more cool stuffs
  - [rudybot](https://github.com/offby1/rudybot) is another possible starting point

## Completed Integration Projects
