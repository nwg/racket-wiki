As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on June 21st, 2016, [Vincent St-Amour](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stamourv/) spoke about the [Typed Racket optimizer](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/tree/master/typed-racket-lib/typed-racket/optimizer) library with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io).

The archived Google Hangouts on Air event is [here](https://plus.google.com/events/chm87mh4umkdpkomk8k8i2lmi7o). It is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtR3NupaRAQ).

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and is not an introduction to Typed Racket itself.

We used [commit 1ba8e5b](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/commit/1ba8e5ba335641d938b1ce0bf9668185ac303e54) of the Typed Racket package for the walk-through.
