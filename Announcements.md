If you write a new Racket package, app, blog post, tutorial or video...the community wants to hear about it.

The racket community uses a variety of tools to communicate and this page lists the ones you can use to make your announcement.

Guidance: Put a prefix otherwise tag your announcement so it is clear it is an announcement.
