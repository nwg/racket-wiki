The Inside Racket seminar seeks to expose the internal design and implementation of Racket features. It features Racketeers give a low-level walkthrough of the code that implements an important Racket feature. This is not a tutorial on the feature or the features of Racket used to implement it, but a kind of oral history of the software and how it works. Our hope is that this will increase the ability of others to build and maintain similar software as we share this kind of expertise in a way that doesn't fit our existing distribution mechanisms (research papers, RacketCon talks, documentation, etc.)
