# Tips on Starting a Racket User Group

Starting a user group is a great way to improve your Racket skills and find others interested in Racket in your area. If you’ve never run a user group before, that’s ok! Anyone can do it.

A user group needs the following elements:

1. **A place to meet.** Finding a regular meeting place is sometimes the biggest hurdle a group faces when getting off the ground. Often the ideal option is finding a company that can host a group after-hours. If that’s not an option, some other choices include universities, colleges, libraries, churches, or coffee shops.
1. **Agree on a time.** It’s important to establish a rhythm to keep a group going. Pick a night (like the 2nd Tuesday of the month) and try as much as possible to have your meeting on that same night every month.
1. **A web presence.** It’s important to have an address on the web that can be found by a search engine. See below for some tools you can use.
1. **Racketeers!!** You can’t have a meeting without people. Ask around on the racket mailing lists for people that might be interested.
