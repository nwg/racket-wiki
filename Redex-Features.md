List of fixes/features for the planned Redex hackathon:
* multi-hole evaluation contexts
* `traces' analogue for judgment-holds
* allow unquoting in judgment premise side-conditions
* cross-language metafunctions
* don't-bind-don't-care
* matching on more than just sexprs: structs, sets, hashes
* general "debugging" friendliness
