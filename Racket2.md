A wishlist of backwards incompatible things for a future Racket2.

* Remove cond's default else-is-void clause and replace with a default else-is-error
* Enable internal definitions everywhere
* Enable the racket/package define* form everywhere
* Use keywords in more places, such as unifying member, memv, memf, etc.
* struct definition macro that allows the naming of the accessors/constructors/etc
* include pattern matching forms in more binding positions
