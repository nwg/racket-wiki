If you want to make something new in Racket, you have a lot of options;
1. Create an executable (add example)
1. create a command line app
1. create a GUI app
1. create a web app
1. create a mobile app
1. single-page web app 

you can also
1. create a library
1. create a language












Misguided attempt to create a *table* of options : (ignore or remove this)

| *app* | *library* | *language* |
|executable(example?)|dll/dylib?|compiler|
|command line app|utility|REPL|
|GUI app(example?)|component|IDE(DrRacket)|
|web app(example?)|web service(example?)|platform?|
|mobile app(example?)|component|?/NA|
|single-page web app(racket compiled to js)|node lib|urlang/racketscript?|
