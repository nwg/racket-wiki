Wow! Racket has so many features, a full-featured **functional** and **[object-oriented](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Programming_with_Class_in_Racket.html)** language with powerful [macro](http://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/) facilities, gradual typing and a static type checker. (It is safe and fun!)
