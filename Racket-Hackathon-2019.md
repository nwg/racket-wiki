The Hackathon has a few suggested projects:

# Your own project

Do your thing, have fun, talk to the people around you and get advice from colleagues.

# Data Science

Work on some data science-related libraries in Racket. Consider looking at some recent mailing list posts for ideas:

- [Use cases for tables and records](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/3Ve4UlOmnpo/udLRfywiBgAJ)
- [table data structure in Racket](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/QlpECxy9cHI/50VGle9xBQAJ)

If you plan to work on a package on GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), consider making an issue with a checklist of possible tasks to work on during the hackathon. Then add a link to the issue here:

# AWS Lambda Runtime

Make an AWS Lambda runtime for Racket!

# GameJam

Build a game using Racket. Jay McCarthy will give a quick tutorial on some of the libraries that are available. The code for his tutorial is at [jeapostrophe/gamejam-2019](https://github.com/jeapostrophe/gamejam-2019) on Github.

# LangJam

Implement the core of a language in Racket. Maybe implement your own version of a well-known language or do something totally new!
