Welcome to the Racket wiki!  Racket documentation is [here](http://docs.racket-lang.org).

We plan to replace this eventually with a wiki written in Racket, to which we will migrate the existing content.

If you're interested in the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012), go to [[this|Summer of Code 2012]] page.

Also see the [[Intro Projects]] page if you want to get started on hacking in Racket.
