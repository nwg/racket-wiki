**What is Racket?**: Racket is a [general-purpose programming language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html) thatâ€™s also an ecosystem for developing programming languages. 

> _[The Racket Manifesto](http://felleisen.org/matthias/manifesto/) outlines the origin, purpose and future direction of Racket from its creators._

The [Racket Distribution](https://download.racket-lang.org) includes the Racket language(s), command line tools, and DrRacket IDE.
