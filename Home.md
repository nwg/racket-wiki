## Welcome  

Racket is a [general-purpose programming language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html) that’s also the world’s first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages.

If you are new to [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) the [website](http://racket-lang.org) <<http://racket-lang.org>> is is a good starting point with examples, [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/) and ways to find support and engage with the Racket community.  The [getting-started](https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) covers installation, 

**[Teach Yourself Racket](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/TYR/)**(TYR): is a rapid introduction to the basics of programming in full Racket, intended for mature programmers.
