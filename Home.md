Welcome to the Racket wiki! 
* The [Racket website](http://racket-lang.org) is the best place to get started if you are new to Racket.
* if you are looking for documentation go to [Racket documentation](http://docs.racket-lang.org).
* The [mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org) is the best place to get help  

We plan to replace this wiki (eventually) with a wiki written in Racket, to which we will migrate the existing content.

* See the [[Artifacts]] page for Racket snippets for specific small tasks.  Contribute your own!
* See [[Math-Library-Features]] to suggest features for the math library.
* See the [[Videos]] page for Racket-related videos.
