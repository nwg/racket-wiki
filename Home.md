Welcome to the Racket wiki!  Racket documentation is [here](http://docs.racket-lang.org).

We plan to replace this eventually with a wiki written in Racket, to which we will migrate the existing content.

Need a project idea?
  * [[Racketeer Office Hours 2017 Task Ideas]]
  * [[Intro Projects]] if you are just getting started
  * [[Larger Projects]] for the more ambitious Racketeer ...
  * [Ideas from the Hackathon](https://github.com/plt/racket/wiki/RacketCon-Hackathon-2012)
  * [[Low risk ways you can use Racket at work]] you can start right now (yes, here, click this one!)

Remember the [Racket Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/index.html) is your friend for solving problems, [DrRacket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/interface-essentials.html) is a powerful IDE that can help write and debug your code (and [macros](http://docs.racket-lang.org/macro-debugger/index.html#%28part._.Using_the_.Macro_.Stepper%29)), and don't forget to check the [Racket Package Repository](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/) for packages that can help you complete your project.
