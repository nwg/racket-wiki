This is the organization page for the Hackathon at [RacketCon 2013](http://con.racket-lang.org/).

* Where: TBD
* When:  28 September, 2013
* What to bring: a laptop

Food: we will be providing lunch (pizza)

The plan for the Hackathon is to encourage work on small, self-contained improvements that can be finished in a short amount of time. Of course, people are free to work on other projects if they would prefer. Racket developers will be around to give advice and help.

Some suggested projects are listed below. The main categories are documentation improvements, FFI bindings, and web APIs.

To make documentation improvements, fork the [Racket git repo](https://github.com/plt/racket) and make your changes there. Most of the core documentation can be found at `collects/scribblings/`. When you're done, submit a pull request and a developer will review and suggest changes or merge it. For help with pull requests, see the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
