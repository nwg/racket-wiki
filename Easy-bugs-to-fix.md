***

Old version of this page - some of these issues have been resolved but none have been labeled as 'good first issue' so can't be found with the above links.

*** 

This page should include a curated set of bugs in the *Racket bug tracker* (offline http://bugs.racket-lang.org/) that should be fairly easy to fix.  This is meant to help guide volunteers who'd like to contribute back to the Racket source tree.

Note: Racket bug tracker is now archived at <https://github.com/racket/gnats-bugs>

* [PR-9312](https://github.com/racket/gnats-bugs/blob/master/drscheme/9312): Modify the content of the [string-constants](http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/tree/HEAD:/collects/string-constants/private) associated to portuguese.
* [PR-12977](https://github.com/racket/gnats-bugs/blob/master/mred/12977): Typo on `combo-field%` docs.
