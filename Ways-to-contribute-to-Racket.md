**An important way you can contribute even if you are very new to Racket;**

While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it could be improved.  Debugging documentation requires a supply ofignorance, which is rapidly used up as documentation testers learn what the documentation means.  **So when you find the documentation obscure**, _treat it as a documentation bug and report it_ by sending an email with your observations and suggestions to the [Racket mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org) (Racket has a friendly community that welcomes feedback)

Maybe, when you become an expert and your supply of ignorance has run out, you can even propose patches to improve that documentation!

## Ways you can contribute to the Racket ecosystem

* [[Code Improvements]] for a list of tasks. These are improvements to the Racket source.
* Try a [Project](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Project-Ideas)
  * If you make a library, [publish it](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/getting-started.html), so other Racket users can find it and use it.
  * If you make an app you can use DrRacket [to create an executable you can distribute](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/create-exe.html) or use [Raco to create Stand-Alone Executables](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe-dist.html)
* [Easy bugs to fix](https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/Easy-bugs-to-fix)
* [Extend DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html) with a [Teachpack](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html#%28part._teachpacks%29) or a [Plugin](https://docs.racket-lang.org/tools/index.html)
* [make your own language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/languages.html) (documentation)
  * [beau­ti­ful racket](https://beautifulracket.com) is the best place to start
* [[Integration Projects]] These are improvements to other systems to better support Racket.
