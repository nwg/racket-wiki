# How to contribute to the Racket project?

There are many ways to contribute, and you can contribute at any level, no matter how experienced or inexperienced with racket or software development. In a large project like Racket there are lots of options: 

* Contribute code, in the form of new features, libraries, bug fixes to either Racket, the racket tool chain, or racket libraries. You may also make your own libraries, languages, or applications for inclusion in the [Racket package catalog](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/). 
  * testing is also an important way to contribute; so log that issue, and if you can solve it, submit a PR.
* Contribute to the documentation of Racket by reporting issue, or submitting changes.
 * Another important way to contribute documenting Racket is tutorials, and a good source of tutorials is things you learnt how to do like [write macros](https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/) or [Deploying Racket applications on Heroku](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2015/08/22/deploying-racket-applications-on-heroku/). While these examples are blog posts, video tutorials or screencasts are also great.(use tools like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), QuickTime, or [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif) to make videos or gif's)
* donating to the Racket project is a great help, and is tax deductible. 
* Organising social things like a coding competition, game jam, hackathon, or meetup.
* outreach like answering racket questions that pop on other forums like stack overflow, twitter, or reddit (/r/learnprogramming or /r/scheme).
* raise awareness by talking about what you are making with Racket on social media; like linkedin, twitter, Hacker news  or facebook.

## Donate
**[You can support Racket with a tax-deductible donation](https://racket-lang.org/sfc.html)** (_you can also set up **recurring payments** with PayPal_)

## Contribute to the Racket Documentation

**This is an important way you can contribute even if you are very new to Racket** (and its a great way to learn)

While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it could be improved. So when you find the documentation obscure, Please treat it as a documentation bug and report it by sending your observations and suggestions to;
* email the [Racket-users mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org), **or** 
* [racket-users on google groups web interface](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users), **or**
* [logging an issue](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/new)

Pull requests to improve the documentation are also welcome!
