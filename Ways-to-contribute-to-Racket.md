# How to contribute to the Racket project?

## Donate
You can support Racket with a tax-deductible donation [Donate](https://racket-lang.org/sfc.html)- _you can also set up recurring payments_.(PayPal)

### **An important way you can contribute even if you are very new to Racket;**

While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it could be improved. **So when you find the documentation obscure**, Please _treat it as a documentation bug and report it_ by sending an email with your observations and suggestions to the [Racket mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org) or https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users (Racket has a friendly community that welcomes feedback)

> Maybe, when you become an expert and your supply of ignorance has run out, you can even propose patches to improve that documentation!
