##  There are many ways to get involved!

There are many ways to contribute, and you can contribute at any level, no matter how experienced or inexperienced with racket or software development. In a large project like Racket there are lots of options:

* [[Report a bug]]
* [[Propose a fix or enhancement]]
* Review and test fixes and enhancements
* **Build things!** [[a language|Creating Languages]], [applications](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html), [[libraries|Creating Packages]], [scripts](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/index.html), [[websites|Web Development]]...and don't forget to [tell us all about it](https://gitlab.com/racket-news/racket-news.gitlab.io/-/issues/new).

Donate Money
------------

The Racket infrastructure (e.g. servers) needs money to operate. Donating is a great help, and is tax deductible.

## Contribute to the community 

An important way to contribute documenting Racket is tutorials, and a good source of tutorials is things you learnt how to do like [write macros](https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/) or [Deploying Racket applications on Heroku](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2015/08/22/deploying-racket-applications-on-heroku/). 

Video tutorials or screencasts are also great. (use tools like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), QuickTime, or [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif) to make videos or gif's)

* Organising events including sprints, coding competitions, game jams, hackathons, or meetups.

* Answering racket questions forums like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/racket), or reddit [r/Racket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Racket/) [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) or [r/scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Racket/r/scheme).

* raise awareness by talking about what you are making with Racket on social media; like linkedin, twitter, Hacker news  or facebook.
