# How to contribute to the Racket project?

There are many ways to contribute, and you can contribute at any level, no matter how experienced or inexperienced with racket or software development. In a large project like Racket there are lots of options:

**Build things!** Applications, libraries, scripts, websites...and don't forget to tell us about it.

* [[Contribute to Racket]] itself
* Create new libraries: [Tutorial: Creating a Package](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2017/10/tutorial-creating-a-package.html) by Stephen Chang & [Getting Started with packages](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/getting-started.html)
* [[Create a language|Creating Languages]]

Don't forget to post your creations in the [Racket package catalog](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/). 

* testing is also an important way to contribute; so log that issue, and if you can solve it, submit a PR.
* [[Contribute to the Racket Documentation]] by reporting issue, or submitting changes. [[Documentation Improvements]] has ideas where you can help improve the documentation

## Contribute to the community 
* Another important way to contribute documenting Racket is tutorials, and a good source of tutorials is things you learnt how to do like [write macros](https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/) or [Deploying Racket applications on Heroku](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2015/08/22/deploying-racket-applications-on-heroku/). 

Video tutorials or screencasts are also great. (use tools like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), QuickTime, or [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif) to make videos or gif's)

* donating to the Racket project is a great help, and is tax deductible. 
* Organising social things like a coding competition, game jam, hackathon, or meetup.

* Answering racket questions forums like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/racket), or reddit [r/Racket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Racket/) [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) or [r/scheme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Racket/r/scheme).
* raise awareness by talking about what you are making with Racket on social media; like linkedin, twitter, Hacker news  or facebook.

* [[Code Improvements]] for a list of tasks. These are improvements to the Racket source.
* [[Documentation Improvements]] has ideas where you can help improve the documentation
* [Extend DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html) with a [Teachpack](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/extending-drracket.html#%28part._teachpacks%29) or a [Plugin](https://docs.racket-lang.org/tools/index.html)

  * If you make a library, [publish it](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/getting-started.html), so other Racket users can find it and use it.
  * If you make an app you can use DrRacket [to create an executable you can distribute](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/create-exe.html) or use [Raco to create Stand-Alone Executables](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe-dist.html)

## On the web

* <http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_Racket> or http://www.timb.net/popular-languages.html 
* Did you make something with Racket or use Racket at work? write a blog post, or share it on linkedin/reddit/facebook/twitter/hackernews/etc.

## Older guides to contributing to Racket
Note: some things have changed since these blog posts were written, but they remain mostly accurate; ask on the racket mailing list if you have any questions. (it is a very friendly community)
