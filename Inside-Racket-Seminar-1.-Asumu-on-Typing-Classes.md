As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on January 14th, 2016, [Asumu Takikawa](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/asumu/) spoke about [Typed Classes](http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-reference/Typed_Classes.html) with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io).

The archived Google Hangouts on Air event is [here](https://plus.google.com/events/chaeqmdp734takcoeel5nnj3las?hl=en). It is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XClR0TwN3k4).

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and assumes an understanding of the class system generally and type system implementation ideas.

We used [commit 1f5c514](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/commit/1f5c5144f91f9f1b3132a28b88a339c0c945e66b) of the Typed Racket package for the walk-through, which was current at the time.
