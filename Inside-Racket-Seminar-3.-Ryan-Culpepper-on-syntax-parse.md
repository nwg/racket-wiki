As part of the [[Inside Racket Seminar]] series, on April 27th, 2016, [Ryan Culpepper](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ryanc/) spoke about the [syntax/parse](http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/stxparse.html) with [Jay McCarthy](http://jeapostrophe.github.io).

The archived Google Hangouts on Air event is [here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cj9u27pp3a912t9g01prvj36osg). It is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-c0vPKeRic).

The seminar is oriented on the details of the implementation and is not an introduction to syntax/parse itself.

We used [commit caebbc65](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/caebbc65b67fbd9965d54e1201459279e5962208) of the Racket package for the walk-through, which was current at the time.

During the presentation, Ryan mentioned a blog post about `lazy-require`. It is available on [his blog](http://macrologist.blogspot.com/2011/10/lazy-module-loading.html).
