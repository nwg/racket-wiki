[[Contribute to the Racket Documentation]]

**This is an important way you can contribute even if you are very new to Racket** (and its a great way to learn)

While Racket is much better documented than most free software, it could be improved. So when you find the documentation obscure, Please treat it as a documentation bug and report it by sending your observations and suggestions to;
* email the [Racket-users mailing list](https://lists.racket-lang.org), **or** 
* [racket-users on google groups web interface](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/racket-users), **or**
* [logging an issue](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/new)

Pull requests to improve the documentation are also welcome!
