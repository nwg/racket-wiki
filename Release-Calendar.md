# Release Calendar

Racket releases happen every 3 months, with occasional exceptions. We use a calendar-based release process, releasing with the features that are implemented rather than waiting for specific features.

Past Racket releases are [here](http://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html).

Future Racket releases will be on the following schedule (these are times when the release process begins):

* April 2020 (7.7)
* July 2020 (7.8)
* October 2020 (7.9)
* January 2021 (7.10)
