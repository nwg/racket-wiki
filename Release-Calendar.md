# Release Calendar

Racket releases happen every 3 months, with occasional exceptions. We use a calendar-based release process, releasing with the features that are implemented rather than waiting for specific features.

Past Racket releases are [here](http://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html).

* July 2017 (6.10)
* October 2017 (6.11)
* January 2018 (6.12)
* April 2018 (6.13)
