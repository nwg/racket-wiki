# Release Calendar

Racket releases happen every 3 months, with occasional exceptions. We use a calendar-based release process, releasing with the features that are implemented rather than waiting for specific features.

Past Racket releases are [here](http://download.racket-lang.org/all-versions.html).

Future Racket releases will be on the following schedule (these are times when the release process begins):

* October 2018 (7.1)
* January 2019 (7.2)
* April 2019 (7.3)
* July 2019 (7.4)
