List of fixes/features for the planned Redex hackathon:
* multi-hole evaluation contexts
* `traces' analogue for judgment-holds
* allow unquoting in judgment premise side-conditions
* cross-language metafunctions
* don't-bind-don't-care
* matching on more than just sexprs: structs, sets, hashes
* general "debugging" friendliness
* disable caching for individual metafunctions (but not the metafunctions they call)
* "type-checking"-like thing for metafunctions: at the very least, every clause's pattern should have the same arity as the contract
** even better: check that the clause's pattern is a refined version of the pattern from the contract (this may be hard)
